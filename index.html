                    Anxiety doesn’t always present itself in obvious ways; it can manifest differently from person to person. Some may experience overwhelming feelings of fear, while others may struggle with physical symptoms like racing heartbeats or difficulty breathing. Additionally, anxiety can spread through different aspects of life, impacting relationships, work performance, and overall well-being. By exploring these diverse manifestations, we gain a deeper appreciation for the challenges faced by those living with anxiety.
